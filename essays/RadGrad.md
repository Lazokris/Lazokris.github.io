<h1 style="font-family: monospace; text-align: center; color: darkcyan" >What is RadGrad </h1>
<p style="font-family: Papyrus; color: blue">RadGrad is an academic website that provides students with various tools to guide them in their academic careers and future. RadGrad can help students who are still undecided in their career choice, plan for their academic career, and get real-life experienceâ€”getting your first career job in Tech can be difficult without getting any experience. Taking classes is not enough; employers are looking for candidates who have an entry-level experience that goes along with it. RadGrad can help bridge those gaps by helping students plan effectively.  RadGrad can help connect you with others in the same career field, find Mentors, and maybe even an internship.</p> 

<h1 style="font-family: monospace; text-align: center; color: darkcyan" >Cool Concepts</h1>
<p style="font-family: Papyrus; color: blue" >The site is easy to use with its interactive interface. Some of the functions I enjoyed were My ICE, Degree Planner, and Level Up. The My ICE page helps students track if they are getting enough experience or credits to finish their Academic careers. If a student is not meeting the requirements, a priority page will show a list of items that need tending. There is also a Degree Planner page where students can add courses, real-life experiences that can help their future careers. In RadGrad, you can also Level UP when you accomplish certain benchmark goals. The leveling idea is a good concept because it motivates students to work on their craft and reduces inactivity.</p>

<h1 style="font-family: monospace; text-align: center; color: darkcyan" >How it works</h1>
<p style="font-family: Papyrus; color: blue" >RadGrad offers a wide variety of Computer Science interests to choose from; these interests represent topics relevant to your degree experience.  RadGrad efficiently helps students by highlighting related goals, courses needed to get a certification, and opportunities that can help me reach a future career in that field. For example, in my interest tab, I've chosen Software Engineering as one of the interests I want to pursue. RadGrad would then compile related courses like ICS 314 and 414 to be accomplished. It also lists Opportunities like Cracking the Coding Interview, which would increase my chance of passing a job interview. Overall, I think RadGrad is a great tool that can help increase my chance of landing a career in Tech because it can help with the planning of finishing my degree and connect me with a community interested in the same field as I am.</p>
