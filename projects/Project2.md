# Pokemo Binary Search Tree
A Binary Search Tree is a node-based data structure that stores items in a sorted manner; it consists of Leftsubtree and Rightsubtree. A parent node will be the key item to distinguished which subtree the item will be stored.  The key is obtained by using an algorithm of finding the middlemost item. After, the key item will be used to compare which subtree it will be stored. If the value of the next item is less than the key, it will be stored to the left subtree, and if the value is larger than the key to the right. For the project, my Professor used Pokemon objects, which compared names, types, power level, etc., to test how to check objects with similar types.
