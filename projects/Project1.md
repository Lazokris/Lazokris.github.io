## Hash Table with Chaining 
Hash Table with chaining is a project I have done in Kapiolani CC. It taught me the concept of storing values in a Hash Table. It is an array-based Hash Table that utilizes various methods to store, organize, locate and delete items. "put()" method stores the item in the array using a key to determine a location for the item in the array. "get()" is used to search the array-based Hash Table and output the item, and "remove()" is used to deleted items from the array, which are initialized by an entry class.

The project also taught me how to distinguish similar items using a boolean compare method that takes in a parameter to compare and output true if they are similar, false if not. Overall the Hash Table project gave me an insight into how to use their functions properly. However, I still need more practice to utilize them proficiently.
