# Learning Experience
Hash Table with chaining is a project I have done in Kapiolani CC. It taught me the concept of operating a Hash Table. It is an array-based hash table that utilizes LinkedList, which consists of nodes needed to be stored. It required me to learn how to use a function like a get(), remove(), and put() to be able to organize the storing of the items in the array. The project also taught me how to distinguish similar items using a boolean compare method that takes in a parameter to compare and output true if they are similar, false if not. Overall the Hash Table project gave me an insight into how to use their functions properly. However, I still need more practice to utilize it better.
