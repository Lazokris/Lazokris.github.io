The Pokemon GUI project is a group project that demonstrates the cumulative Java lesson I've learned at Kapiolani Community College. The project required my team and I to build a game simulation of the popular game Pokemon. The game simulation had four commands buttons, Hunt, Catch, Check, and Look. The Hunt button initializes a random generator that randomly selects a Pokemon and its stats which we created implementing Object Class and using methods like implements and extends to connect multiple Object Classes. The Catch button lets you try and catch the Pokemon; if successful, the Object will be stored in a Deque and Priority Queue, organized in a Binary Tree Data Structure. The Check (stats) button gives you access to the Pokemon caught, which calls on the Deque or Priority Queue interface to print the Object. Lastly, there is the Look button which prints the Pokemon Object. The Objects are store in an ArrayList. Creating the Pokemon GUI was a lot of work, but it did present me with greater knowledge. Also, it was fun seeing it work.
