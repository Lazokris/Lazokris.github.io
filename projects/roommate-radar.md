### What is Roommate-Radar
Roommate Radar is a Web Application group project created for the purpose of helping University of Hawaii students find other like-minded students to share an apartment. Some of its features are creating a profile to display personal information such as Name, Year of Graduation, Preference in Pets, and Rent. An Edit Profile feature is also added to revise their info according to the changes made in their lives. Students would use the List Profile feature to access other profiles searching for their perfect roommate, easily traversed using the Filter Feature (Not yet operational).
