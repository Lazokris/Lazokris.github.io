I am not entirely sure of what I aspire to be in life. All I know is that I want to create a lifestyle that I can enjoy living. I choose a career path in Computer Science base on things I like. I enjoy playing games, problem-solving, and team activities, which led me to start studying Software Engineering; if I could learn how to develop a game, I could create one day. Problem-solving is also an integral part of many Computer Science fields. Machine Learning uses complex algorithms to solve issues that are happening in the world. It would be a great feeling to know that what I do can help change the world for the better. 

Having a Work-from-Home option is also enticing to me. Because most of the work needed in Software Engineering can be online, with the exception of physical meetings, doing work from home can be an option. This is good because it could allocate my commute time to spend on more useful activities. I also want to have the ability to support myself, not worry about financial burdens. I believe a career in Software Engineering can provide that.
